          "In_Depth_Explanation": "The Pantheon's magnificent portico is a Greek-style entrance porch, featuring 16 massive Corinthian columns made of granite from Egypt. Each column is 11.8 meters (39 ft) tall, 1.5 meters (5 ft) in diameter, and weighs about 60 tons. The triangular pediment above the portico once held sculptures of gods and emperors, though these have been lost to time. The inscription on the frieze attributes the building to Marcus Agrippa, though the current building was constructed by Hadrian. The portico was an important addition by Hadrian, creating a transitional space before entering the rotunda, and its design has influenced countless buildings worldwide.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation

The rotunda's diameter and height are equal at 43.3 meters (142 ft), creating a perfect sphere that could fit inside the cylinder of the room. The walls are 6 meters (20 ft) thick and feature seven alcoves alternating with eight recesses, which help to support the weight of the dome. The alcoves once held statues of Roman gods, while the recesses likely contained statues of emperors.

It is made of unreinforced concrete, with the mix getting progressively thinner and lighter toward the top to reduce the weight bearing down on the walls. The dome features five rows of 28 coffers (sunken panels) that help to lighten the structure and create a decorative pattern. At the center of the dome is the oculus, a circular opening 8.8 meters (29 ft) in diameter that lets in light and rain. The oculus and the coffers create a stunning play of light and shadow throughout the day.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation

It is open to the sky, allowing rain to enter and fall to the floor, where it drains away through discreet holes. The oculus symbolizes the connection between the earthly and celestial realms, and its size and position create a dramatic shaft of light that moves around the interior throughout the day. During special events, rose petals are sometimes dropped through the oculus, creating a stunning spectacle.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation

The square features a central fountain designed by Giacomo Della Porta in 1575, topped by an Egyptian obelisk that was added in 1711. The obelisk was originally located in the Temple of Ra in Heliopolis, Egypt, and was brought to Rome in ancient times. The square is surrounded by historical buildings, including the Church of Santa Maria Rotonda, which was built in the 15th century using materials from the Pantheon. The Pantheon Square is a popular gathering place for locals and tourists alike, with numerous cafes, gelato shops, and souvenir stores lining the perimeter.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation

          "In_Depth_Explanation": "The Pantheon has a rich and complex history spanning nearly 2,000 years. It was originally built around 25-27 BC by Marcus Agrippa, a close friend and son-in-law of Emperor Augustus, as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome. However, the current building is a result of a complete reconstruction ordered by Emperor Hadrian in the early 2nd century AD. The Pantheon survived the fall of the Western Roman Empire and the turbulent times that followed, largely due to its conversion into a Christian church in the 7th century by Pope Boniface IV. It was consecrated as the Church of St. Mary and the Martyrs, which ensured its preservation and maintenance throughout the Middle Ages and beyond. The Pantheon has served as a source of inspiration for countless artists, architects, and engineers, and its influence can be seen in buildings around the world, from the United States Capitol to the Jefferson Memorial. Today, it stands as a testament to the enduring legacy of ancient Roman architecture and the ingenuity of its creators.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation

          "In_Depth_Explanation": "Over the centuries, numerous legends and stories have become associated with the Pantheon. One popular legend claims that the oculus was created by the devil when he fell through the dome after being tricked by a saint. Another story suggests that the dome was built using lightweight pumice stones and that the oculus was left open because the weight of the stones would have caused the dome to collapse if it were closed. While these stories are not historically accurate, they reflect the sense of wonder and mystery that the Pantheon has inspired throughout its long history. Other legends are tied to the famous figures buried in the Pantheon. For example, it is said that if you place a coin on Raphael's tomb, you will be blessed with artistic talent. Similarly, some believe that the Pantheon is haunted by the ghosts of those interred within its walls. These legends and stories add to the Pantheon's allure and its enduring fascination for people around the world.", // Renamed Description to In_Depth_Explanation
